Scenario: Create an invoice
	Given I am on the admin invoices page with properly login information
	Then I should have an invoice page
		Examples: "Test Client"
		|Client     |Project     |Issue     |Work_Unit    |Completed_Date|Hours|Invoice_id|
		|Test Client|Test Project|Test Issue|Test Work Unit|2011-08-24   |7.5  |          |
	When I submit invoice with "invoice_id" as "abc"
	Then I should not see "Test Client" on the admin invoices page
